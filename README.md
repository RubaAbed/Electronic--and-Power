## Task 1 Electronic circuit design for servo motor


In this task, I opened the simulation program ( AUTODESK Tinkecad ) on the Arduino in order to design an electronic circuit and then I chose the circuit and from there I chose to create a new circuit, then I searched and wrote a servo. A servo engine appeared to me I chose and then I downloaded the code


## Task 2 Electronic circuit design for stepper motor

In this task, I opened the simulation program ( AUTODESK Tinkercad ) on the Arduino in order to design an electronic circuit and then I chose the circuit and from there I chose to create a new circuit, then I searched and wrote 9V Battery and I chose it and then Arduino and I chose it and then Breadboard and I chose Breadboard Small and then the wires are as shown In the picture, then I wrote this code in the Stepper motor file and started Simulation
