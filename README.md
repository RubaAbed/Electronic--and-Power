## Task 1 Electronic circuit design for servo motor


In this task I opened the simulation program (AUTODESK Tinkercad) on the Arduino in order to design an electronic circuit and then I chose the circuit and from there I chose to create a new circuit, then I searched and wrote Arduino and I chose and then servo and I chose it and then I chose Breadboard and I chose Breadboard Small and then wired them with Some as shown in the picture, then I wrote the this code in the Stepper motor file started the simulation to run the servo motor


## Task 2 Electronic circuit design for stepper motor

In this task, I opened the simulation program ( AUTODESK Tinkercad ) on the Arduino in order to design an electronic circuit and then I chose the circuit and from there I chose to create a new circuit, then I searched and wrote 9V Battery and I chose it and then Arduino and I chose it and then Breadboard and I chose Breadboard Small and then the wires are as shown In the picture, then I wrote this code in the Stepper motor file and started Simulation
